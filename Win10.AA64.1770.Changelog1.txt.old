						Modified and built on 22/04/2020 by Empyreal96 XDA Member

##THIS IS NOT A PIRATED VERSION. ACTIVATION WILL BE NEEDED IF NOT USED WITH WOA DEPLOYER AND TEST MODE##

INSTRUCTIONS: You will need an 'install.wim' from an unedited 17760 (1809) ISO
because WoA Deployer doesn't agree with the edited version.

	1. Make sure you have the 'stock' install.wim from ISO and the Version1.wim in the same folder.
	2. Open WoA Deployer > Browse for the Wim files > select the 'Stock' install.wim
	3. When WoA detects the 'Stock' .wim, go back to the Wim Folder > rename install.wim to installbak.wim
	4. Rename Version1.wim to install.wim
	5. Go back to WoA and Start deployment. 

Note: Renaming the modified wim after selecting the 'stock' wim is like a hdd hotswap, the program WoA sees the 'stock' wim
and loads it, then swapping the name of the Version1.wim to install.wim fools WoA to deploy with the edited unrecognised wim.
You may encounter, after finishing deploy and drivers have been injected, an error syaing invalid .WIM file.. this is expected 
but the deployment was still successful
