# W10-ARM64-Resources
 Repository containing scripts and files used for my Win 10 ARM64 WIM for use with WoA Deployer..



**Boot**: Contains an older bootaa64.efi file (Needed sometime if receive bootloop)

**Scripts**: These are scripts used in the WIM Image (SetupComplete.cmd, newuser.bat)

**Scripts\Update-Service-Tool.bat** - A little batch to start and stop win updates on the go, also has some safe to disable services because its pulled from my main project over at XDA which is ongoing work in progress.
